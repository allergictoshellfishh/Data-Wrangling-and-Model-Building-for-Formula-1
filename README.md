# Data Wrangling and Model Building for Formula 1
This project applies data wrangling and basic machine learning techniques to solve a real-world prediction problem using the Ergast Formula 1 dataset. Multiple CSV tables containing race, driver, constructor, and results data were integrated into a single analytical dataset through joins, filtering, and aggregation.

The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for modelling. A naïve baseline model and a simple machine learning model were built and evaluated to compare performance and highlight limitations. Overall, this project demonstrates practical experience in working with complex datasets, transforming raw data into meaningful features, and applying analytical reasoning under time constraints.

## Prediction Problem
The objective is to predict the total race completion time for each driver in a Formula 1 race. To address this prediction problem, I can leverage the selected datasets to identify correlations between various factors relating to a race and its completion time. By integrating data from the 'lap_times', 'pit_stops', 'qualifying', 'races', 'results', and 'status' datasets, I aim to develop a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts completion time for the race for each driver.
