Performed data wrangling, cleaning and transformation on tables to build models for Formula 1 predictions.

## Prediction Problem
The objective is to predict the total race completion time for each driver in a Formula 1 race. To address this prediction problem, I can leverage the selected datasets to identify correlations between various factors relating to a race and its completion time. By integrating data from the 'lap_times', 'pit_stops', 'qualifying', 'races', 'results', and 'status' datasets, I aim to develop a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts completion time for the race for each driver.
